# Clock Planner Code Cleanup

## Changes Made

### Removed Duplicated Time Selection UI
- Removed duplicated time selection display section from AnalogClock.tsx
- Fixed UI duplication between AnalogClock and TodoForm components
- The time selection information (time range display and "Click on the clock" message) was appearing twice in the UI
- Kept the functionality in TodoForm.tsx and removed it from AnalogClock.tsx to eliminate redundancy

This cleanup ensures a cleaner UI without duplicate information being displayed to the user.

- Added automatic clearing of time selection after a task is added
  - Updated handleFormSubmit to call resetSelectionState after submitting a task
  - Ensures clock selection is cleared along with form fields after adding a task
